Back in 1999 I received an email from a software developer working for NASA!, asking me if they could use this grid!.
Apparently it was part of some UI representing the status of video surveillance cameras recording the various bits and pieces of rocket boosters placed on there shuttles.
I receved a screenshot from a live launch back then. I was of course thrilled and excited. Now that email correspondance and the screenshot...well they say forgotten backups can make a grown man cry, I can confirm that.

Anyways... I do feel that I am connected to outer space, occasionally ;-)
